                    <p>This simple, yet very delicious dish, consists of a hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with Durban curry. Bunny chow's origin dates back to the arrival of migrant Indian workers who have since settled throughout South Africa. Thanks to the culinary influence of Indian South Africans, today bunny chow has been adopted nationwide and is enjoyed in many different variations.</p>
